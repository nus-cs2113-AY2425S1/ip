### Saving Data

Aether automatically saves your tasks to the `data/aether.txt` file after any changes. There is no need for manual saving.

---

## FAQ

### Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

A: Install the Aether application on the new computer and run it once to generate the default data file. Then, overwrite the generated data/aether.txt file with the one from your previous computer to transfer all your tasks.

---

## Editing the Data File

Aether automatically saves your task data in a text file located at `./data/aether.txt`, relative to the directory where you run the program. Advanced users can update their tasks by directly editing this file.

> ⚠️**Caution:** Be cautious when editing the file directly, as improper formatting may cause errors or data loss when the application is next launched.
