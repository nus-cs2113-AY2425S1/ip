# Taylor Task Management Chatbot

Welcome to **Taylor**, a simple Java-based task management chatbot designed to help you organize your tasks effectively. Taylor can handle various task types such as Todos, Deadlines, and Events. This guide will walk you through setting up and using Taylor to manage your tasks.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 17, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first).
2. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   2. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   3. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
3. Configure the project to use **JDK 17** (not other versions) as explained in [this guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
4. After that, locate the `src/main/java/Taylor.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Taylor.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the following as the output:
   ```
   Hello! I'm Taylor.command.Taylor
   What can I do for you?
   ```
