## Features
Notes about the command format:

1. Words in **UPPER_CASE** are the parameters to be supplied by the user.

   e.g. in `todo DESC`, `DESC` is a parameter, like `todo go to school`.


2. Command words are **case-sensitive**.

   e.g `list` is valid, but `LIST` is invalid.


3. **Whitespaces** are required between every word in the input.

   e.g. `list1` will not execute `list` command.


4. Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as help, list, exit) will be ignored.

   e.g. `list 1-10` will be treated the same as `list`.

### Adding ToDo tasks: `todo`
Adds a `ToDo` task to the task list.

Format: `todo DESCRIPTION`

**Examples:**

* `todo go school` adds a `ToDo` task with description `go school`.

### Adding Deadline tasks: `deadline`
Adds a `Deadline` task to the task list.

Format: `deadline DESCRIPTION by DUE-DATE`

* The input for `DUE-DATE` has to be entered in the format `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`.

**Examples:**

* `deadline finish homework by 2024-10-10 1200` adds a Deadline task with description `finish homework` and
due-date `2024-10-10 1200`.

### Adding Event tasks: `event`
Adds an `Event` task to the task list.

Format: `event DESCRIPTION from FROM-DATE to TO-DATE`

* The inputs for `FROM-DATE` and `TO-DATE` have to be entered in the format `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`.

**Examples:**

* `event finish homework from 2024-10-10 0600 to 2024-10-10 1000` adds an `Event` task with description `finish homework`,
from-date `2024-10-10 0600` and to-date `2024-10-10 1000`.

### Listing all tasks: `list`
Shows a list of all tasks in the task list currently.
```
Your task list:

Wah shag, good luck with your tasks bro!
```

Format: `find KEYWORD`

* This method is **case-insensitive**, e.g `finish` will match `FINISH`.

* `KEYWORD` can consist of multiple words. 

* Only tasks that contain the entire `KEYWORD` will be found.

**Examples:**

* `find finish` returns all tasks that contain the word `finish`.

**Note**

* The indexes of the tasks in the shown list **don't correspond** to their indexes in the complete task list.

### Filtering tasks by date: `filter`

```

Format: `filter DATE`

**Examples:**

* `filter 2024-10-10` shows a list of tasks that occur on `2024-10-10`.

**Note**

* The indexes of the tasks in the shown list **don't correspond** to their indexes in the complete task list.

### Marking a task as done or undone: `mark`/`unmark`
Marks an existing task as done/undone.

Format: `mark INDEX`/`unmark INDEX`

* Marks the task at `INDEX` as done/undone. 

* The value of `INDEX` is the same as the one shown in the task list.

* The value of `INDEX` must be a positive integer (1, 2, 3,…).

* If the value of `INDEX` is not within the task list, the program prints the following message:

```
Index out of bounds lah bro
```

**Example:**

`mark 2` marks the task with an **'X'** at index 2 with an in the task list to indicate it is done.

```
Your task list:
1.[T][ ] eat lunch

Wah shag, good luck with your tasks bro!
```


### Deleting tasks: `delete`

### Saving/Loading of task data
**Saving:**

The program saves the data in the task list to the hard disk after every command. There is no need to save anything manually.

**Loading:**

When the program is initialised, it loads the data from the saved file into the task list.
If the save file does not
exist, the program will create an empty file and a directory at the required file path for you.

**Filepath:**

The filepath for the save file is `[JAR file location]/data/taskdata.txt`.
