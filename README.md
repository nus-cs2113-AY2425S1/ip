## Quick start

1. Ensure that you have Java 17 or above installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/jemehgoh/ip/releases).
3. Copy the file into the folder 
4. Open a new terminal in the folder you copied the `.jar` file into, and enter the following command:
   ```
   java -jar nell.jar
   ```
   Upon running the command, the following messages should be printed in your terminal:
   ```
   Hello! I'm Nell!
   What can I do for you?
   ```

## Features

> ### Notes on commands
> 
> * Words in `UPPERCASE` represent parameters that are to be entered by the user.  
> e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter, like in `todo buy bread`.
> * Command words are **case-sensitive**.   
> e.g. the program will interpret `LIST` as an invalid command, even though `list` is valid.
> * For commands that do not take in parameters (like `list` and `bye`), additional parameters
> entered will be ignored by the program.  
> e.g. the program will interpret `list 1-10` as `list`.

### Adding `ToDo` tasks: `todo`

Adds a `ToDo` task to the task list. 

Format: `todo DESCRIPTION`

Examples
* `todo buy bread` adds a `ToDo` task with description `buy bread`.

### Adding `Deadline` tasks: `deadline`

Adds a `Deadline` task to the task list.

Format: `deadline DESCRIPTION /by BY-DATE`
* The value at `BY-DATE` has to be entered in the format `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`.

Examples
* `deadline collect laundry /by 2024-10-01 1200` adds a `Deadline` task with description `collect laundry` and  
by-date `2024-10-01 1200`.

### Adding `Event` tasks: `event`

Adds an `Event` task to the task list.

Format: `event DESCRIPTION /from FROM-DATE /to TO-DATE`
* The values at `FROM-DATE` and `TO-DATE` have to be entered in the format `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`.

Examples
* `event do laundry /from 2024-10-01 0600 /to 2024-10-01 0800` adds an `Event` task with description `do laundry`,  
from-date `2024-10-01 0600` and to-date `2024-10-01 0800`.

### Listing all tasks: `list`

Shows a list of all tasks in the task list.


```
-> The tasks listed are as follows:
   1. [T][ ] buy bread
   2. [D][ ] eat bread (by: 30/09/2024 13:30)
```

Format: `list`

### Finding tasks by keyword: `find`

Finds all tasks in the task list that contains a specified keyword, and shows a list of those tasks.

```
-> The matching tasks are as follows:
   1. [T][ ] buy bread
   3. [D][ ] eat bread (by: 30/09/2024 13:30)
```

Format: `find KEYWORD`
* The finding is case-insensitive, e.g `bread` will match `Bread`.
* If multiple words are entered for `KEYWORD`, only the first word will be searched for. 
* Only tasks with entire words matching will be found, e.g `cs` will return `CS` but not `CS2113`.

Examples
* `find bread` returns all tasks that contain the word `bread`.

Note
* The indexes of the tasks in the shown list correspond to their indexes in the complete task list.

### Searching for tasks by date: `search`

Shows a list of all tasks that occur on a particular date.

```
-> The tasks on this date are as follows:
   2. [D][ ] eat bread (by: 30/09/2024 13:30)
   3. [E][ ] freeze bread (from: 28/09/2024 06:00 to: 20/10/2024 18:00)
```

Format: `search DATE`
* The value of `DATE` has to be entered in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`.

Examples
* `search 2024-09-30` shows a list of tasks that occur on `2024-09-30`

Note
* The indexes of the tasks in the shown list correspond to their indexes in the complete task list.

### Marking a task as done: `mark`

Marks an existing task as done.

Format: `mark INDEX`
* Marks the task at `INDEX` as done. The value of `INDEX` is the same as the one shown in the task list.
* The value of `INDEX` must be a positive integer (1, 2, 3,...).
* If the value of `INDEX` is not within the task list, the program prints the following message:

```
-> Invalid task!
```
  
Example
* `mark 2` marks the task at index 2 in the task list as done.

### Marking a task as not done: `unmark`

Marks an existing task as not done.

Format: `unmark INDEX`
* Marks the task at `INDEX` as not done. The value of `INDEX` is the same as the one shown in the task list.
* The value of `INDEX` must be a positive integer (1, 2, 3,...).
* If the value of `INDEX` is not within the task list, the program prints the following message:

```
-> Invalid task!
```
  
Example
* `unmark 1` marks the task at index 1 in the task list as not done.

### Removing a task: `remove`

Removes a task from the list.

Format: `remove INDEX`
* Removes the task at `INDEX` from the task list. The value of `INDEX` is the same as the one shown in the task list.
* The value of `INDEX` must be a positive integer (1, 2, 3,...).
* If the value of `INDEX` is not within the task list, the program prints the following message:

```
-> Invalid task!
```
  
Example
* `remove 1` removes the task at index 1 from the task list.

### Exiting the program: `bye`

Exits the program.
Upon exiting, the program shows the following message:

```
-> Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
```

Format: `bye`

### Saving of task data

The program saves the data in the task list to the hard disk after every command. There is no need to save manually.  
The task list data is saved in the file `[JAR file location]/data/data.txt`.

### Loading of task data

When the program is initialised, it loads the data from the saved file into the task list. If the saved file does not  
exist, the program creates an empty file and its directory at the file path.
