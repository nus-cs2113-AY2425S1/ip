## Quickstart

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Grab the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/TVageesan/ip/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Medea.
4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the java -jar medea.jar command to run the application.
5. Once you see the welcome message, you may begin entering commands. Refer to [features](#features) for full list of commands.

## Features

> **Caution:**  Command Format Notes
> - **Words in UPPER_CASE** are the parameters to be supplied by the user.  
    e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`.
> - **Parameters must be input in the specified order.**  
    e.g. if the command specifies `/from START /to END`, `/to END /from START` will cause data inaccuracy.
> - **Extraneous parameters** for commands that do not take in parameters will be ignored.  
    e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

## Saving Data
Task data is saved automatically to the hard disk when the application is exited. No manual saving is required.

## Editing the Data File
Task data is saved as a CSV file at the designated file path. Advanced users can update data directly by editing that file.

> **Caution:** If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, the application may discard all data and start with an empty file at the next run. Therefore, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it. Certain edits can cause the app to behave unexpectedly, so proceed with caution.
