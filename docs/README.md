## Quickstart

2. Download the latest Rizzler `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/nirala-ts/ip/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Rizzler.
4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the java -jar Rizzler.jar command to run the application.
5. Once you see the welcome message, you may begin entering commands. Refer to [features](#features) for full list of commands.

## Features
> **Caution:**  Command Format Notes
> - **Words in UPPER_CASE** are the parameters to be supplied by the user.  
    e.g. in `todo TASKNAME`, `TASKNAME` is a parameter which can be used as `todo recite a poem`.
> - **Parameters must be input in the specified order.**  
    e.g. if the command specifies `/from START /to END`, `/to END /from START` will cause data inaccuracy.
> - **Extraneous parameters** for commands that do not take in parameters will be ignored.  
    e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

## Saving Data
Rizzler automatically saves your task data to a file upon exiting. You do not need to manually save your tasks.

## Editing the Data File
Task data is stored as a CSV file in the designated storage path. You can edit this file manually, but be cautious:
an incorrect format may lead to data loss. It is recommended to back up the file before making edits.

> **Caution:** Editing the data file directly can lead to unexpected behavior and loss of data. Proceed with caution.
