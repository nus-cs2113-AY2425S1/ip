### Adding Tasks: `todo` / `deadline` / `event`

### Deleting Tasks: `delete`

Deletes a task from the task list. Upon adding the task, the task tracker will also show
the number of tasks in the task list.

Format: `delete INDEX`
* Deletes the person at the specified INDEX.
* The index refers to the index of the task in the task list.
* The index **must be a positive integer**, and must be the index of an existing task in
the task list ( i.e. index must be smaller than or equal to current size of task list.)

Examples:
* `delete 2`: Deletes the 2nd task in the task list (Assuming task tracker has at least 2 tasks).
If task tracker has less than 2 tasks, task tracker will inform user that the entered task index is invalid.
