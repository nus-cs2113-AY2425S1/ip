# Aerus User Guide
*Organize and manage your tasks with ease!*

Welcome to Aerus, an application that helps you manage tasks and more!
This is a quick introduction to get you started.

## Getting Started with Aerus
Aerus runs on Java 17. To get started, put the .jar file into your desired folder and run.

Aerus keeps track of three types of tasks: 
- To-do (tasks with a short description only), 
- Deadline (with a final date), 
- Event (with a start and end time). 

You can mark each task as done or undone and view/delete them at any time.

Aerus automatically saves your tasks after each session.

## The `help` command
Type `help` anytime to see a list of the app's commands as follows.

```
list                                            : view all your tasks
todo     [description]                          : note down a todo task
deadline [description] /by [time]               : note down a deadline task
event    [description] /from [time] /to [time]  : note down an event task
search   [input query]                          : search for tasks by description

unmark   [task number]                          : mark a task as undone
delete   [task number]                          : delete a task from Aerus
bye / quit                                      : Exit the program
```
