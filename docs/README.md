ℹ️ **Notes**:
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are placeholders for user-supplied parameters.  
  e.g., `todo TASK` means `todo` is the command and `TASK` is the user-provided task description, such as `todo Read a book`.
- Commands can be entered in any order as long as the required parameters are present.
- Invalid or extra parameters for commands that don’t accept arguments (e.g., `list`, `bye`) will be ignored.

## Error Handling

### Invalid Commands
If the system does not recognize a command, it will return an error message such as:
```bash
Unknown command: <your input>
Please use the 'help' command to see the command list.
```

### Missing Arguments
If a command is entered without the required arguments (e.g., `mark` without a task number), the system will notify you of the missing information:
```bash
The 'mark' command requires a valid task number.
```

### Out-of-Range Task Indices
If you try to mark, delete, or unmark a task that does not exist (e.g., task number 10 when there are only 5 tasks), the system will alert you:
```bash
Task number does not exist.
```

### Invalid Date Format
If an invalid date format is entered for a deadline or event, the system will respond with:
```bash
The 'deadline' command requires a valid date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
```

### Empty Input
If no command is entered, the system will prompt the user to enter a valid command:
```bash
Please enter a valid command. Type 'help' to see available commands.
```

## Saving Data

Bebe Task Manager automatically saves your tasks to a file after any modification. You don't need to save manually.

---

## Editing the Data File

The task data is saved in a `tasks.txt` file. You can edit this file directly, but ensure the format remains valid to avoid errors when loading the data.

**Caution:**  
If you make changes that corrupt the format, Bebe Task Manager may discard all your tasks and start fresh with an empty list the next time it's run. Always back up the data file before making edits.
