## FAQ

**Q: How do I save my tasks?**  
A: KaiWen automatically saves tasks to `data/tasks.txt` whenever a task is added, deleted, or marked as done.

**Q: What happens if the task file is corrupted?**  
A: If the task file is corrupted or not in the expected format, KaiWen will discard the file and start with an empty task list. Make sure to back up the file regularly if you edit it manually.

**Q: Can I edit the task file directly?**  
A: Yes, the task data is stored in a text file (`data/tasks.txt`), and you can edit it manually. However, please ensure you maintain the correct format.

## Known Issues

- If you accidentally delete the tasks.txt file, KaiWen will start with a blank task list.
- Incorrectly formatted commands will result in error messages, but KaiWen will continue running.
