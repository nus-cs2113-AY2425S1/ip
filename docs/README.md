# Appal User Guide

![Starting up Appal](appalscreenshot.png)

Appal is your best pal with whom to track your tasks, such as your todos, deadlines and events, and you can access them
by listing the tasks or filtering the list to find specific tasks. For each Appal session, your task list will be saved
right into your laptop too!

## **Features**

> [!NOTE]
> Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in `todo TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter that requires the user's input, such as `todo homework`.

> [!NOTE]
> Tasks that are added to the task list in Appal are by default unmarked, and after each change to the task list,
> the task list is saved.

If the user has previously saved tasks from a previous session, Appal will load it up in the current session.
