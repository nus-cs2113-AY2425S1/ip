# Features

### Input Formatting Guide
- White spaces at the very front and end of the input are safely ignored
- White spaces between different parameters are safely ignored
  - e.g. deadline &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; homework &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /by &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tomorrow
- White spaces within format identifiers (e.g. /from, /by, etc.) will lead to input being rejected
  - e.g. **ev&nbsp;&nbsp;ent** CCA Meeting **/fr&nbsp;&nbsp;om** morning /to tonight
- Date and time inputs must match exactly the formats outlined later, and no whitespaces within them are allowed

### Interpreting Output Format
Tasks are shown to the user in the following format
`[Z][X] description [time/date]`
- In the first box, the letter (Z) represents the task type
  - T = **todo** task
  - D = **deadline** task
  - E = **event** task

- In the second box, the letter (X) represents whether the task is marked as done or not done
  - X = task is marked as **done**. 
  - (blank) = task is marked as **not done**.

## Saving your List of Tasks

Your list of tasks is saved automatically every time you add, modify or delete a task

The save data is written to a .txt file located at `[JAR file location]/data/tasks.txt`

## Editing Save File

Users are welcome to edit the save file if they wish to do so

However, if the tasks are modified to a different format than what is accepted by the system,
then the modified tasks may be incorrectly registered by Doug. Take caution when doing so.
