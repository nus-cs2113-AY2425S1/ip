This is a command-line-based chatbot designed to help you organize and track your tasks. 

It supports various task-related commands, such as adding, marking as done/undone, deleting, finding tasks, and listing all tasks.

2. Download the latest .jar file from here.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Task Manager.

## Features
Notes about the command format:

Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in todo TODO_TASK, TODO_TASK is a parameter which can be used as todo read books.

Words in angle brackets are determined by the actual situation.
e.g. in todo <task_num>, task_num refers to the total number of tasks in the list.
