## Features

### Adding Tasks

Quinn supports three types of tasks: ToDos, Deadlines, and Events.

#### Adding a ToDo
Command: `todo <description>` <br>
Example: `todo Buy groceries`

#### Adding a Deadline
Command: `deadline <description> /by <date> <time>` <br>
Example: `deadline Submit report /by 2023-05-15 1400` <br>
* For proper recognition of `date` and `time`,
   * `date` has to be entered first, followed by `time`.
   * `date` has to be in the format `yyyy-MM-dd` (e.g. `2024-01-21`).
   * `time` has to be in the format `HHmm` (e.g. `1400`) and can be optional. 
   * Nonetheless, any other string e.g. 13121995 will still be accepted, albeit not formatted
   * (i.e. the same exact string "13121995" would be displayed.)

#### Adding an Event
Command: `event <description> /from <start date> <start time> /to <end date> <end time>` <br>
Example: `event Team meeting /from 2023-06-20 0900 /to 2023-06-20 1100` <br>
* For proper recognition of `date` and `time`,
   * `date` has to be entered first, followed by `time`.
   * `date` has to be in the format `yyyy-MM-dd` (e.g. `2024-01-21`).
   * `time` has to be in the format `HHmm` (e.g. `1800`) and can be optional.
   * Nonetheless, any other string e.g. 13121995 will still be accepted, albeit not formatted
   * (i.e. the same exact string "13121995" would be displayed.)

## Command Reference

• todo [description]: Add a ToDo task <br>

• event [description] /from [start date] [start time] /to [end date] [end time]: Add an Event task <br>

## Understanding Task Types
Quinn supports three types of tasks:

• ToDo: A simple task without any date/time constraint.

Displayed as: [T][ ] <Task Description>


• Deadline: A task with a specific due date and time.

Displayed as: [D][ ] <Task Description> (by: Date Time)


• Event: A task with a start and end date/time.

Displayed as: [E][ ] <Task Description> (from: Start Date Time to: End Date Time)

The square brackets next to the task type indicator (T/D/E) show the task's completion status: <br>
[ ]: Task is not done <br>
[X]: Task is done

## Error Handling
   Quinn will display error messages if it encounters issues. Here are some common errors and their meanings:

"INVALID COMMAND. Please try again!": The command entered is not recognized. <br>
"The description of a todo cannot be empty!": You need to provide a description for the ToDo task. <br>
"INCOMPLETE COMMAND": Some required information is missing from the command. <br>
"Task not found. Please try again!": The task number provided doesn't exist in the list. <br>
"Please enter a valid task number to be marked as done!": The mark/unmark command requires a valid task number. <br>

If you encounter an error, read the error message carefully and adjust your command accordingly.


## Data Storage
   Quinn automatically saves your tasks to a file named "tasks.txt" in a "data" folder in the same directory as the Quinn.jar file. This ensures that your tasks persist between sessions.
   Note: Do not modify the "tasks.txt" file manually, as this may cause Quinn to malfunction.
