## Quick start
1. Ensure you have Java `17` installed on your Computer.
2. Download the latest .jar file from [here](https://github.com/Yisoong/ip)
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* for the program.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in,
   and use the `java -jar Ryan.jar` command to run the application.
5. Type the command in the terminal window and press Enter to execute it.
6. Refer to [Features](#Features) below for details of each command.

## Features
> **Notes about command format:**
>
> Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters supplied by the user.
> - e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo Assignment`
>
> Words in lower_case are to be typed exactly
> - e.g. in `deadline DESCRIPTION /by BY` should be typed as `deadline Quiz /by 2024-10-15`,
    > where `deadline` and `/by` should be typed exactly
>
> Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as list, bye) will be ignored.
> - e.g. if the command is `list everything`, it will be interpreted as `list`
