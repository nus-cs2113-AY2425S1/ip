## Getting Started

When you first run Yapper, you will be greeted with a start-up message, and a help message:
```

```
The command keyword is always in lowercase.

### Adding and Deleting Tasks

To add a ToDo task, 
use the todo command followed by the task description 
e.g. `todo todoDesc`.
```
___________________ PROGRAM OUTPUT BELOW ___________________
Now, I gotta remember this too:
  [T][ ] todoDesc
If I counted correctly, you have a task total of 1
Don't worry, I've already memorized all about it!
```

To add a Deadline task, 
use the deadline command followed by the task description then an end date, 
e.g. `deadline deadlineDesc /by endDate`.
```
___________________ PROGRAM OUTPUT BELOW ___________________
Now, I gotta remember this too:
  [D][ ] deadlineDesc, due endDate
If I counted correctly, you have a task total of 2
Don't worry, I've already memorized all about it!
```

To add an Event task, 
use the event command followed by the event description, a start date then an end date, 
e.g. `event eventDesc /from startDate /to endDate`.
```
___________________ PROGRAM OUTPUT BELOW ___________________
Now, I gotta remember this too:
  [E][ ] eventDesc, from startDate to endDate
If I counted correctly, you have a task total of 3
Don't worry, I've already memorized all about it!
```

To delete a (ToDo, Deadline or Event) task,
use the delete command followed by the task number, 
e.g. `delete 1`
```
___________________ PROGRAM OUTPUT BELOW ___________________
Now I don't need to remember this one anymore: 
  [E][ ] sleep, from today 2300 to tomorrow 0800
If I counted correctly, you have a task total of 0
Don't worry, I've already forgotten about it! 
```

### Listing All Tasks

To list all tasks in your task list, 
use the list command without any parameters.
e.g. `list`
```
___________________ PROGRAM OUTPUT BELOW ___________________
You're forgetting already? Lemme refresh your memory: 
1.[T][X] todoDesc 
2.[D][ ] deadlineDesc, due endDate 
3.[E][ ] eventDesc, from startDate to endDate 
That should be all of them. Did I forget any? 
```

### Finding Tasks 

To find tasks,
use the find command followed by the query string,
e.g. `find CS2113`
This will list all tasks which have that query in its description, if any.
```
___________________ PROGRAM OUTPUT BELOW ___________________
Hmmm, let me think. What tasks could you be referring to? 
3.[T][O] CS2113 iP 
4.[T][X] CS2113 tP 
2 task(s) found contains your query string. 
___________________ YAPPING OUTPUT BELOW ___________________
Is any of them what you were looking for? 
```

### Marking and Unmarking Tasks

To mark a task as complete, 
use the mark command followed by the task number,
e.g. `mark 1`
```
___________________ PROGRAM OUTPUT BELOW ___________________
I know, you told me that this task is done
  [T][O] procrastinate
Keep it up! What are you gonna do next? 
```

To unmark a task as incomplete, 
use the unmark command followed by the task number,
e.g. `unmark 1`
```
___________________ PROGRAM OUTPUT BELOW ___________________
I know, you told me that this task is not done
  [T][X] be productive
Keep going, you'll get it done eventually!
```

## Command Summary

If a command requires additional parameters, they must be included and must be in the same order indicated.

If a command does not require additional parameters, do not include anything after the command keyword.

Command keywords are always in lowercase.

Do note that parameters must be of a certain type: 
* desc, date, query are strings.
* ordinal is an integer.

## Save File

The task list is saved in a file, savedata.txt, located in the data folder.
This file is updated in real-time, i.e. it updates every time you 
add (todo, deadline, event), remove, or update (mark/unmark) the list.

When Yapper boots up, it searches for that file and converts its contents into a task list.
However, it can only convert text in a particular format, so edit the file with caution.


Don't worry if you accidentally deleted your save file or the folder that it is in.
The next time you update the task list in the terminal, 
Yapper will create a new file (and its folder, if necessary) and fill the file in with the tasks it has.

However, as much as possible, try to make sure this doesn't happen. 
The file/folder creation may take a while to reload.

If you both delete the save file and end the program without saying anything to Yapper, 
your tasks are gone forever and there is no way to get them back.
