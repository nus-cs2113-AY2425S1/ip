   ```
   find book
   ```
- **Expected Outcome**: 1. [T] [ ] Finish reading book

### **9. Saving Data**

Wildpeace automatically saves your tasks to a local `tasks.json` file after any modification. You do not need to manually save the tasks. When you restart the application, your tasks will be loaded from this file.

---

### **10. Editing the Data File**

Advanced users can directly modify the `tasks.json` file, which is stored in the application's directory. This file is formatted as JSON, so be cautious when editing it. Incorrect formatting may cause the application to fail when loading the tasks.

---

## **FAQ**

### **Q:** What happens if I make an invalid command?

**A:** Wildpeace will show an error message to indicate that the command was invalid, and will prompt you to try again.

### **Q:** How do I transfer my tasks to another computer?

**A:** You can copy the `tasks.json` file from your current computer to another. Place the file in the same directory as the `.jar` file on the new computer, and Wildpeace will load the tasks upon starting.
