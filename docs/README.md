tasks, deadline tasks and event tasks to their list of items to do. Allowing for better organisation
and planning. Users can also mark tasks as done or unmark tasks as done. If the task is no longer
relevant, users can delete the task. Lastly, users can use the find feature to search for specific 
tasks.
